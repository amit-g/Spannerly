## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amit-g/Spannerly.git
cd Spannerly
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `npm run export` - Export static files for deployment

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployment-agnostic and can be hosted anywhere without code changes.

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to configure deployment paths:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` - Sets the base path for the application (e.g., `/Spannerly` for GitHub Pages)
- `BASE_PATH` - Alternative environment variable name for the same purpose

### Local Development

For local development, no environment variables are needed:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will run at `http://localhost:3000` with no base path.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The application automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. Builds the application with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` set to the repository name
2. Generates static files optimized for GitHub Pages
3. Deploys to `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

### Custom Deployment

For deployment to other platforms or custom paths:

```bash
# Set the base path for your deployment
export NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/your-custom-path"
npm run build

# Or for Windows PowerShell
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/your-custom-path"
npm run build
```

### Supported Deployment Platforms

- **GitHub Pages** (automatic via GitHub Actions)
- **Vercel** (zero config)
- **Netlify** (static export)
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- **Any static hosting service**

## Architecture

### Services Layer
Each tool capability is implemented as a service with a defined interface:
- `TextService` - Text manipulation capabilities
- `MeasurementService` - Unit conversion capabilities  
- `CurrencyService` - **Real-time currency conversion with API integration and caching**
- `DateTimeService` - Date and time utilities
- `ImageService` - Image processing capabilities
- `AsciiArtService` - **ASCII art generation using figlet.js with multiple fonts**
- `RandomGeneratorsService` - Random data generation (passwords, UUIDs, etc.)
- `StringUtilitiesService` - String manipulation and formatting utilities
- `CryptographyService` - Encryption, decryption, and hash generation

### Component Structure
- **Tool Components**: Individual tool implementations
- **Service Integration**: Tools use service layer for business logic
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system
- **Placeholder System**: Graceful handling of unimplemented tools with informative messages

### Recent Improvements
- **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Integrated fawazahmed0/exchange-api for live exchange rates with smart caching and fallback mechanisms
- **ASCII Art Generation**: Added figlet.js integration with multiple font options and proper browser compatibility
- **Placeholder Tool System**: Professional "under development" messages for tools not yet implemented, showing planned features and categories
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling across all services with user-friendly messages
- **API Integration**: Robust API integration patterns with fallback mechanisms and caching strategies

### Theme Customization
The application supports multiple theme options:
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Color Schemes**: Choose from Blue, Green, Purple, Orange, and Red color schemes
